# Handwriting-detection using the MNIST Data Set using Keras API


Build a deep neural network to recognize handwriting digits 0-9 from the [_MNIST DataSet_](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) that has thousands of training and test handwritten numbers data.

This uses _Keras_, a high-level API on top of _TensorFlow_ which is an open-source library with great deep learning implementations.

The **display_sample.py** script is used to view the MNIST dataset samples by visulaising them using [_matplotlib._](https://matplotlib.org/)

**Handwriting0-9Keras.py** trains, compiles and evaluates a _sequential nueral network model_.
